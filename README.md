# TIC TAC TOE by Stan

This application allows two users to play as many rounds of tic-tac-toe as they would please.
One primary user can invite a friend to play with them. They both must manually make selections to place their symbols into the grid. Players must register with the system to enable game functions including the game itself, saving options, and login record reconciliation. This project was excellent practice in implementing the skills that I have gained thus far at General Assembly within the first 3 weeks of the course.

## Planning Story

I followed the recommended [plan](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/game-project/blob/master/schedule.md) provided by my instructors. I began with the HTML to create the layout sketched in my wireframe. I stylized it using Bootstrap and practiced writing my css in Sass. I moved on to understanding the game logic and logistics. The final part of the project was dedicated to authentification and game api protocols. Overall time taken for this assignment was about 35 hours. This is version 1 beta.

### User Stories

- As a user I want to sign up and login
- As a user I want to by able to play tic tac toe.
- As a user I want to keep track of the player's turn and update the api with each move.
- As a user, I want to be able to store my game statistics and retrieve them as needed.
- As a user, I want a fast and responsive application.
- As a user, I want a visually appealing interface to keep grab my attention.

### Technologies Used

- jQuery
- HTML/CSS

### Future Improvements

- I want to remove my alerts and console.logs!
- I want to allow players to choose their symbols.
- I would like to add a cpu player.
- I want to add animations to interactable elements.
- I want to further stylize the application.
